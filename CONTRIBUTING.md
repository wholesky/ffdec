# How to contribute

## Pull requests
You can fork our decompiler on GitHub and then create pull request.
Pull request target branch should be `dev`, as this is main development branch.

## GUI vs Library
Make sure library part (libsrc/ffdec_lib) does not depend on GUI and does not contain anything GUI related.

## Tests
Make sure existing tests pass.
